How to work with a code challenge

- don't underestimate; resist the urge to dive into code
- read the description 3 times; produce an outline if necessary
- communicate with clarity
  - ask questions upfront
- have a plan (algorithm), and verify
- test cases (happy paths, fail paths, edge cases)
- manage your energy
  - leave time for tricky parts
- abstraction
